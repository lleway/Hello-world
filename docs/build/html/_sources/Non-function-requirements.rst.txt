Non-function-requirements
==========================

Response time 
---------------
Since this is an academic program and it is possible for
biologists to pay more attention to these data than the average person,
it should be as short as possible.
So the provisional response time <5 seconds.

Aesthetic aspects
-------------------
Since this is an academic procedure, 
it should be as concise as possible 
so that biologists can use it as quickly as possible 
and understand this software. 

Confidentiality Policy
----------------------
    As a public web application, the security of data must be a 
    significant part to be considered. Especially for biologists, 
    every experiment result is derived uneasily. Therefore, when 
    users are using the application, their data must be used and 
    stored properly.
    In other words, **the web application must maintain the experiment data's** 
    **reliability, integration and secrecy and the experimental data will not** 
    **be divulged without the agreement of the owner.**
