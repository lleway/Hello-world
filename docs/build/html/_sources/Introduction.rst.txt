Introduction
================
 The Hill laboratory's initial demand for 
 online applications (OHI gene) allows our 
 scientists to upload gene expression files 
 and quickly obtain differentially expressed genes. 
  
Purpose:
----------
 Biologists can upload gene expression 
 files on their own and quickly acquire
 differentially expressed genes. 
 And the users need us to make a web application.
 
Overview: 
------------
 We should design a simple Web web page, which should have a text box and a button for uploading the text and running the user. 
 If the user uploads the correct file, then a differential expression 
 gene will be returned and the X axis of the scatter plot of these genes is the control and the Y axis is the treatment. 
 If it is a wrong file, it will return an interface to remind users to upload the correct file and upload the text box and button.

 This is created for academic research from biologists around the world. 
 We need to use some more general language -- English to create this software.
